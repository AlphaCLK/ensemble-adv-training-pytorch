###### REQUIREMENTS

The code was tested with Python 3.6.7 and Pytorch 1.0.1.

###### EXPERIMENTS

Training a few simple MNIST models. These are described in _mnist.py_.

```
python -m train models/modelA --type=0
python -m train models/modelB --type=1
python -m train models/modelC --type=2
python -m train models/modelD --type=3
```

(standard) Adversarial Training:

```
python -m train_adv models/modelA_adv --type=0 --epochs=12
```
Ensemble Adversarial Training:
```
python -m train_adv models/modelA_ens models/modelA models/modelC models/modelD --type=0 --epochs=12
```
